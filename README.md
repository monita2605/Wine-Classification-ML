Observations
ML Model	Observation
Logistic Regression	Performs well for linearly separable data
Decision Tree	Can overfit if depth not controlled
KNN	Sensitive to scaling and K value
Naive Bayes	Works well for probabilistic assumptions
Random Forest	Reduces overfitting and improves accuracy
XGBoost	Best performance due to boosting
